# Udacity Feed Reader
Project for Udacity's FEND nanodegree. A web-based application that reads RSS feeds.

## Testing
This project required the creation of three test suites using Jasmine. The first one checks if the feeds that are going to be loaded exist and have a valid name anr URL. The second one tests if the menu shows and hides in accordance with the user's clicks while the third one ensures that the reload works as intended. 

## How to use
Open index.html in a browser while having all the required folders in the same folder as index.html. When the page fully loads, click any link to read the respective feed. By clicking the hamburger-menu icon you can change the feed source.
